# ‚öôÔ∏è Proposed Solution Features

1. File Upload & Prediction

Allows users to upload CSV files containing network traffic data.

2. Machine Learning Algorithms

- Algorithms can predict network activity labels based on the input data.
- Random Forest: Handles large datasets with many features.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): Ideal for binary classification tasks.
- Neural Networks: Detects complex patterns in high-dimensional data.

3. Result Visualization

Displays predictions on a user-friendly web interface, listing true and predicted labels.

4. Alert Mechanism (Future Enhancement)

Future updates will include real-time alerts for suspicious activities.

## Setup

1. Generate a new ssh key and add it to github
   [Follow this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5H_KFzla6M)

2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranavh-2004/T3N50R5.git
cd T3N50R5
```

3. Create a branch with your name and switch to it

```bash
git branch "your_name"
git switch "your_name"
git status #to check if u have switched to your branch
```

4. To check if you are able to push changes to github, edit this README.md file with some new text (it can be anything).
   And then push the changes to github

```bash
git config --global user.email "change this with your github email id"
git config --global user.name "change this with your github username"
git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated the readme file"
git push origin main
```

5. To push and pull changes

```bash
git pull origin main  #pulls latest code from the repo
git push origin "your_name" #pushes your commits to your branch in the repo
```

**Never push to main!! And NEVER FORCE PUSH TO MAIN**

6. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Start Python Backend

```bash
python model_server.py
```

8. Start Node.js Server:

```bash
node server.js
```

9. Check setup - open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser
